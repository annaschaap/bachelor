## About the data

In the trajectory work/bachelor/data both the MatchingGame and Questions folder are empty.
These are the file locations where the "raw" data files are supposed to go, but we cannot upload 
them to git. Before running the code, the data should be uploaded to these folders. 

## To run preprocessing code:

Go to work/bachelor/preprocessing/preprocessing.Rmd
All "home-made" functions imported in the file is located in bachelor/preprocessing/functions

## To run the main code:

Go to work/bachelor/Python/main_xgb.ipynb
You can download all necessary requirements by running the requirements file located at 
work/bachelor/Python/requirements.txt
All home-made functions imported in this file is located at work/bachelor/Python/functions.py 

## To plot results:

Go to bachelor/Python/plots.ipynb 
All required packages should already be installed and all home-made functions used here are also 
in the /bachelor/Python/functions.py  

## About the work/bachelor/results folder

This folder contains the old results used in the thesis. New results are stored in 
work/bachelor/Python/results when running main_xgb.ipynb
