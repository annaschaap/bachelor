### Git workflow
(ONLY THE FIRST TIME):
1. go to repository and clone the HTTPS. 
2. Go to terminal (either on computer or preferred interface)
3. cd path/to/where you/want/to/save/the/repository
4. Git clone HTTPS

WORKFLOW: we work in our individual branches and do NOT merge with the main, meaning:
Each time you want to work on the project, you should:
1. ALWAYS WORK IN YOUR OWN BRANCH!!!! you change to your own branch by typing (in the terminal): Git checkout branchname (the name of your branch)
2. When done for the day, always upload newest changes to GitHub. In that way we can see where we are:
    1. Git add .
    2. Git commit - m “message about what have been done”
    3. Git push
  
Here, an overview of the most used github commands:
